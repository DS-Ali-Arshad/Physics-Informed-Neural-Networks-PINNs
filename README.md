Javed Hussain, Tareq Saeed, Ali Arshad

This repository contains the code and results needed to reproduce the experiments from our paper: _**Applications of deep learning algorithm PINN to nonlinear models arisingin finance and economics**_. We demonstrate how **Physics‚ÄëInformed Neural Networks (PINNs)** can be used to solve a variety of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in option pricing (Black‚ÄìScholes, illiquid markets, transaction costs) and a Luttmer‚Äêtype growth/diffusion model.

## **PINNs Architecture**

![PINNs Architecture](PINNs_Architecture.jpg)

---

_**Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**_ are a class of deep learning methods that incorporate physical laws, typically described by PDEs, into the training process of neural networks. This approach allows for the **approximation of solutions to complex PDEs without the need for traditional numerical discretization methods**, which can be computationally intensive or challenging to implement for certain problems.

We apply PINNs to solve several nonlinear PDEs relevant to finance and economics:

- **Option Pricing with Black-Scholes Equation**
- **Black-Scholes Equation for Illiquid Markets**
- **Option Pricing with Transaction Costs**
- **Diffusion and Experimentation as an Engine of Growth**

## üìà Dataset Discussion

Like traditional neural networks, PINNs do not require real-world data for training. Instead, the training dataset is generated computationally and consists of *collocation points*, *initial condition points*, and *boundary condition points*. These are obtained by discretizing the domain, either through meshgrid creation or by random sampling‚Äîusing frameworks such as `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`. In our work, we used `TensorFlow`.

To **test and validate** our results, we compare the outputs of the PINN models with numerical solutions reported in the literature. The partial differential equations (PDEs) we solved, along with their corresponding benchmark results, are drawn from previously published studies. **All relevant sources are cited in our paper: _"Applications of Deep Learning Algorithm PINN to Nonlinear Models Arising in Finance and Economics."_**

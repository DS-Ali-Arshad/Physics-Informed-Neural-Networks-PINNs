# Physics‑Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Models in Finance & Economics
## **Applications of Deep Learning Algorithm PINN to Nonlinear Models Arising in Finance and Economics**
Javed Hussain, Tareq Saeed, Ali Arshad

This repository contains the code, data generation scripts, and results needed to reproduce the experiments from our paper: _**Applications of deep learning algorithm PINN to nonlinear models arisingin finance and economics**_. We demonstrate how **Physics‑Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** can be used to solve a variety of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in option pricing (Black–Scholes, illiquid markets, transaction costs) and a Luttmer‐type growth/diffusion model in macroeconomics.
